# My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This repository contains the source code and content for my personal website, where I showcase my academic projects, professional projects, and credentials. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted using GitHub Pages.

## Website Structure

The website is organized into the following sections:

### Home

The home page provides an introduction to who I am, my background, and a brief summary of my skills and expertise.

### Academic Projects

The academic projects section highlights the projects I completed during my academic studies. Each project is accompanied by a description, key features, technologies used, and a link to the project repository or live demo.

### Professional Projects

In the professional projects section, I showcase the projects I have worked on in a professional setting. Similar to the academic projects, each project includes a description, key features, technologies used, and relevant links.

### Credentials

The credentials section displays my educational background, certifications, and any other credentials that highlight my qualifications and expertise. It includes information such as degrees earned, courses completed, and certifications achieved.
